# 📚 Book Tracker
## 🤝 Partner Project
This began as a pair code project for the Data and SQL Code First Girls course. The project involved creating a database using SQL and also code a few stored function.
I worked alongside [Nasteho Abdi](https://github.com/Nastehooo) to create and present our initial project, earning us both a certificate for the course.

## ⏳ What happens now?
We plan to expand the project further and create an application that uses the Library database and allows a user to track their reading progress as they go.

Logging:
- Completed reads
- To be reads
- To be continued reads
- Current reads
- DNFed reads

## 📈 Progress
The project is currently ongoging in the background of the rest of our work however we aim to complete it / have a working application by the end of 2024 🎆
